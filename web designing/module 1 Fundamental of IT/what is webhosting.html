Web hosting is a service that allows individuals and organizations to make their websites accessible on the internet. Web hosts provide the technologies and infrastructure (such as servers, storage, and network connectivity) needed for a website to be viewed online. When you purchase web hosting, you are renting space on a server where your website files are stored, so users can access your site from anywhere in the world.
