what is URL ?
A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the address used to access resources on the internet, such as web pages, images, or files. It specifies the location of a resource and the protocol used to retrieve it.

Types of URLs in Websites:

Absolute URL: Specifies the complete path, including protocol, domain, and resource location.
Example: https://www.example.com/about.html

Relative URL: Specifies the path relative to the current page or directory.
Example: about.html or ../images/logo.png

Protocol-relative URL: Omits the protocol, using // to inherit the current protocol.
Example: //www.example.com/style.css

Anchor URL: Points to a specific section within a page using a hash (#).
Example: about.html#team
